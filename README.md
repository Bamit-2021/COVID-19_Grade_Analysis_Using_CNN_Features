# COVID-19_Grade_Analysis_Using_CNN_Features

The aim of This project is that it can detect COVID using deep learning. It makes use of CNN and utilizes X-ray images as data sets. X-ray images are fed into image classifying models and also segmentation techniques could be used on them to find affected parts. Normal as well as covid-positive Xrays are fed into the model to train the classifier. It eliminates the hard task of comparing the Xrays and tackles the fine-grained visual recognition problem as the Xrays are quite similar and need to be compared based on textures, sharpness, etc heat maps could highlight affected parts. images--->extract features--->classify model can also be trained for other pulmonary diseases similar in nature to covid like pneumonia, not only that the variant of pneumonia ie bacterial or viral can also be classified.
